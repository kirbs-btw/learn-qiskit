# learning qiskit 

This repo is documenting my journey of learning qiskit...

For now I'm gonna have to look into quantum physics...

gate types - lessons learned... 
- H gate - qubit goes to superposition - or reverts to the state before the superposition
- half rotation alon the axis between x and z
- messurement gate - collapses the wave function - "sets" a state - no superposition anymore
- X gate not gate - 0 ti 1 1 to 0 - half rotation along x axis 
- Y gate half rotation at y axis
- Z gate half rotation at z axis
- Rx, Ry, Rz gate - rotation along the axis with a specific amount


still thinking about a way to use the quantum effects for an alogrithm
